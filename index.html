              <p>A Portland native, I love exploring the great outdoors - especially hiking, camping, and snowboarding. I received my B.A. in Business Administration with a focus in Marketing from the University of Washington in Seattle. I was also a member of the Japan track of the International Studies in Business Program. My mother is Japanese, so I grew up in a bilingual household and I wanted to utilize this skill in my career. After finishing my undergraduate degree, I moved to Japan where I lived for almost 5 years working to help localize global brands like Guinness and Smirnoff. I also worked as a Business Consultant for a short time before moving back to Portland to be closer to my family. Then I decided to make a big career change!</p>

              <h2 class="text-center">Why Coding?</h2>
              <p><strong>Because technology is <em>really cool</em>!</strong> My most recent job as a Consultant on an ERP software project in Japan had opened my eyes to a whole new world of programming and technology. Even before that as a marketer, technology was becoming more important as it played a growing role in the lives of consumers, and more data was available. After moving back to Portland, I met with a good friend of mine who is an iOS developer and she was very enthusiastic about Portland's growing tech scene. She also mentioned that the key to being an awesome developer was having great problem-solving skills. I felt like this would be a great fit for my personality and skillset and enrolled in a coding school right away. Checkout the Projects page to see some of my work!</p>
