            <p>A Portland native, I love exploring the great outdoors - especially hiking, camping, and snowboarding. I received my B.A. in Business Administration with a focus in Marketing from the University of Washington in Seattle. I was also a member of the International Studies in Business Program, and after finishing my undergraduate degree, I moved to Japan where I lived for almost 5 years working to help localize global brands. I moved back to Portland to be closer to my family, and decided to make a big career change!</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">Why Coding?</h2>
            <p>After moving back to Portland, I decided I wanted to try something completely new, but was not quite sure what. Then, I met with a good friend of mine who is a mobile app developer and she was very enthusiastic about Portland's rapidly changing and growing tech scene. She also mentioned that the key to being a good developer was having great problem-solving skills. I felt like this would be a great fit for my personality and skillset, and I'm very eager to be able to contribute to this industry!</p>
