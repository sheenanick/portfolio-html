        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>I was born and raised in the beautiful city of Portland, Oregon. I received my B.A. in Business Administration with a focus in Marketing and a Certificate of International Studies in Business from the University of Washington in Seattle. After finishing my undergraduate degree, I moved to Japan where I lived for 5 years working mainly in sales and marketing. I moved back to Portland earlier this year to be closer to my family, and decided to make a big career change!</p>
        <h3>Why <em>Coding?</em></h3>
        <p>After moving back to Portland, I decided I wanted to try something completely new, but was not quite sure what. Then, I met with a good friend of mine who is a mobile app developer and she was very enthusiastic about Portland's rapidly changing and growing tech scene. She also mentioned that the key to being a good developer was having great problem-solving skills. I felt like this would be a great fit for my personality and skillset, and I'm very eager to be able to contribute to this industry!</p>
